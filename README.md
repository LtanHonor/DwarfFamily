DwarfFamily
===========

Hey guys, because some people asked for it, i'm currently developing a tool, that reads the legends xml, takes all the Dwarfs in it and connects them to a familytree file(Gedcon) so it can be opened by programs like MyHeritage to display a familytree.

Current Status: All Dwarfs get read and connected from legends xml. Outputfile connects all familys together right. Missing now is a interface, so people can select wich legend file they want to use and also the program has troubles with large xml files because java runs out of memory so optimisations left.
